Bulk-manage your Gmail inbox with a Chrome Extension.  
Preview matching emails, then move them to Trash in one click â€” powered by Gmail API + React.

---

## Features
- Build Gmail search queries (Subject, From, Date, etc.)
- Defaults to pulling all emails **older than 30 days** if no query is entered
- Preview results with infinite scroll
- Bulk trash with a progress bar (with cancel)
- Works with Gmail API OAuth (test users or your own client)

## Getting Started

You have two ways to run the extension:

### Option 1 â€” Be added as a test user (recommended)
The simplest way to try it.  
**Action:** Open an issue with your Google account email and Iâ€™ll add you as a **Test User** on the OAuth consent screen. Then:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` â†’ enable **Developer mode** â†’ **Load unpacked** â†’ select the `dist/` (or `build/`) folder.
4. Click the extension icon to open the popup and sign in.

### Option 2 â€” Use your own Google OAuth client
If you prefer to self-host OAuth:

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console** â†’ create a project and **enable Gmail API**.
2. Configure an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (**Application type:** *Chrome Extension*).  
   - Add an authorized redirect URI in the form:  
     `https://<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>.chromiumapp.org/`  
     (Youâ€™ll see your extension ID in `chrome://extensions` after loading it.)
3. Put your Client ID in a `.env` at the project root:
      `VITE_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>`
4. 4. `npm install` â†’ `npm run build` â†’ load the built extension via `chrome://extensions`.

> Note: The app uses Gmail scopes for preview and trash. In **Testing** mode, you must add your Google account under **OAuth consent screen â†’ Test users**.

This is an experimental side project. Use at your own risk â€” messages moved to Trash follow Gmailâ€™s standard deletion window.
